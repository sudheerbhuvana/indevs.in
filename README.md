Welcome to **indevs.in**, where we believe developers should be able to get online without unnecessary cost or complexity. Whether you're an individual developer, a student, or an organization, we provide free managed subdomains to help you publish your projects with no hidden conditions.

With indevs.in, you can register a subdomain and host it using your own infrastructure or any hosting provider of your choice. You remain in full control of your services while we handle subdomain management. Deploy freely, integrate with your preferred stack, and focus on building.

## Why indevs.in?

At indevs.in, our mission is to make publishing on the web more accessible for developers. We believe that domain costs and setup friction should not block learning, experimentation, or early-stage projects. Our goal is to provide a simple, reliable platform where developers can establish a presence online regardless of budget.
